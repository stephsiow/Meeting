The Meeting Cost Calculator is a web application that helps you calculate the cost of your meetings based on the duration and the wages of the attendees. You can use this tool to track and estimate the cost of your meetings in real-time.

## Features

- **Timer:** Start, stop, and resume the timer to track the duration of your meeting.
- **Cost Calculation:** Calculate the total cost of the meeting by inputting the number of participants and their hourly wage rates.

  1. Use the timer to automatically measure the meeting duration.
  2. Manually input the meeting duration in hours and minutes.
